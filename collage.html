            <p style="padding-left: 150px; padding-right: 150px;">
                What i want to do when i am done with schooling can be lots of things. 
                first i need to graduate, but after id love to look into a job for 
                moblie app dovelopment and eventually start to saving real money 
                under my grandmas household. after about a year or two and hopefully
                a raise or two later. id like to move out with plenty of money in 
                savings with intrest! and be able to support myself on my own from 
                then on. and maybe be able to affored a but more depending on how much
                i have saved.</p>
            <p style="padding: 150px;padding-top: 0%; padding-bottom: 0px;">
                if that doesnt end up working out i have many other options 
                because i am so young. i usually am a pretty loud speaker and i 
                love to talk and break ice. some of the things i thought would be 
                other good options would be to be a real estate agent, also standup
                spokesmen sounded as something i thought would be something id like 
                 to look into. honestly i just have a huge perosnality and i try to 
                find any way to express myself</p>
         <h2 style="padding: 150px; color: brown; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">Goals</h2>
            <p style="padding: 150px;padding-top: 0px;">
                my goals for life can always change throughout the years but i have 
                some pretty basic standards for myself and some of them is i want 
                to eventually buy my own car, to be able to move 
                out completly on my own without having a hard time. and i want to 
                eventually get married one day. i know i know it sounds cringe but
                honestly i love the thought of marrage. but the thing is i want to
                 be for sure that its the right person. i would love to eventually
                 try and hit the gym consistantly recently ive been flooded with 
                schooling so i have not been able to find a consistant time and 
                ride there but i was hoping soon id be able to go to a point 
                where id be able to be pretty fit. also for a goal of 
                mine is to be able to make 6 figures on my own. and evetaully down
                the road to buy my own house or even possibly build my own house. 
                another thing that i have on my bucketlist is to try and travel as 
                much as possible and have as much fun while i do it!</p>
